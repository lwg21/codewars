# The grid is 6 row by 7 columns, those being named from A to G.
# You will receive a list of strings showing the order of the pieces which dropped in columns:

# pieces_position_list = ["A_Red",
#   "B_Yellow",
#   "A_Red",
#   "B_Yellow",
#   "A_Red",
#   "B_Yellow",
#   "G_Red",
#   "B_Yellow"]

# The list may contain up to 42 moves and shows the order the players are playing.
# The first player who connects four items of the same color is the winner.
# You should return "Yellow", "Red" or "Draw" accordingly.
